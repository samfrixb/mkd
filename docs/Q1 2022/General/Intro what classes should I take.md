1 Introductory Information

In this week's study, we welcome you to this world of assessing the energy body, and it's completion. The ten modules presented in our research and through our courses will provide an interesting way to connect people with their higher self, higher modes of activity, and, some would say, with God. 

In forming an energetic partnership with the matrix of this world, in terms of the secrets of its energetic life (having an intuitiion that the Great Spirit is speaking to you while in the woods), and of its practical applications throughout the day (feeling you can really connect well with someone), we formulate the possibility of a scientific analysis of our energetic life. 

We make these things testable--whether you are easily able to grasp the spirit's presence, or whether you connect well with individuals in your life. We look at the health of our membership in and participation with groups such as churches (or pools of friend in bars), as well as the healing force we are able to generate. 

And, we study the way this inner emotional life's expression as deep states of peace, connection with Godliness, and so on, is marred in the modern world. 

Will the greatest detractors to our energetic body be trauma, or nutritional issues? Surely these could be relevant. 

But in this week's study, we take on one aim of focus: the energetics of our world.

In each of these six days of work, we will see a book chapter, an audio lecture, and so on--a full study sequence. 

For those who just wish to read the books, or just see what our research beheld, they are free to navigate through the sections. 

All people, practitioners and laypersons alike, have access to the entirety of our course structure. Only slides and the lectures are behind paywalls once you have this document. 

Please do not share this course, and ruin the integrity of our motion towards improving simplicity and access to complex and advanced study programs. If you have friends you wish to share a portion with, please share portions of the first day, and then encourage them to sign up to view the rest of the content. Or, you can send a donation on their behalf. 

All students are eligible for certification. This is merit based. If you would like to proceed to subsequent GSR testing courses, please complete your work diligtently and in the format provided. You can sign up for a mentorship/review consultation for us to review your work in advance of submission, or you can just submit it at the time of certification. There is a $200 fee to participate in GSR II and a $400 fee to participate in GSR III. There is a final $150 fee to complete your certification after conducting your own research program through GSR IV, initial access to which is free. Once you have signed up for these, you have completed our program.
