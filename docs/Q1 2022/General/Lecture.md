2 Lecture

The Lecture Base contains a repository of talks on all aspects of life. These are independently viewable at the Lecture Base. These talks are general content, and are not specifically tied to the lesson plan. So, if you are ready to get working, you can skip these and get right to printing out the slides and testing away. 

But for those who have more time, or who want to more completely absorb the lesson, the audio files will be the most important part of your time spent when it comes to forming a cohesive understanding of the issue taught.
