Have you ever felt a sense of loss of connection between you and your inner meditative state?

We all have differenet ways of grasping the highest thigns in the material reality (things like noticing a friend is sad, or observing what a beautiful view we sit before). But when it comes to the spiritual world, this is much more the case.

Whereas one can readily dive into past life readings, and another can see walls of information presented in the air about the person he is speaking with; still others have a sense that they know what to do with the day based on the way God has guided them, and others pray and they know something worked out in their life based on what they prayed over.

The sense of loss of this connection may be something that is a rarely studied issue, but it should be considered one of high importance.

Christians look at the loss of faith as a behavioral issue, the stereotypical view on Christians goes. They want to judge eveyrone for not choosing to see that God had done everything.

But where is the source for them to see that light, found within the church? It is such a fundamnetal difference of axioms that the conversation becomes impossible. On the one hand, there are those who cannot understand the intellectual matters. Why should I join this church--I don't see (or perceive) anything about it, or its people. In fact, I have observed a lot of hypocrisy over there, or with Christian churches in the past. Based on my intellectual story, knowing God is similar to knowing the Easter Bunny. And it just doesn't add up to my value system.

Another syaing might go, for the Bhuddist type thinker, "Why should I believe in God? Why should I limit the vastness of what is the supreme of the universe, by limiting or trying to define him?" This, oddly, matches a Quaker note. Quakers see scripture as a secondary source and connection with God as the primary source. God knows and speaks to each of us "lovingly and without judgment" whenever we ask questions (James 1:5). And those who know God are anchored in signs, wonders, and miracles (2 Cor 12:12)
