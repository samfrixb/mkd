Johnna has three things (assets) going for her. 
she moves
she cant stand it when someone is wrong
she is absolutely devoted to the Christ

so Florida is an illusion for her, because it makes her feel better

With Donte, the path is: she should stay with Donte. 

and the final "move" here is: I find a $600/month rent to stay in, after taking a trip when he is with her. I go move after I sell the bus in the fall (see sold bus) and I go to this place: a van to build out online. Then I sell the bus (see around october) then I begin a life of homeschool. 
The van is: worthy of the calling. A short school bus or something like it. 
And in the end I will be glad I headed to Asheville, with the bus (see glowing car like a subaru outback on the road as my next car. Something from the father). I'm going up to mystic to get this. 

so my final plan is as follows: to be near the eastern woods. Mystic, Connecticut for life--with a nutrition office called Star Clinic
And I will live in: mystic/Westerly Rhode Island. ANd have a small office that is: a desk, a muscle testing (nutrition massage) table, a deck with a lot of slides in it, and I do muscle testing
But the final thing about this is, *I can do the work.* I live a life where the new master plan is fulfilled every day. I go out by finding a life in new social groups and circles, such that by being in this town (see Asheville) really anywhere near/around it, I won't have missed my destiny. 
Let's move to Asheville and create Star Clinic
Testing all the problmes in the modern world
Freedom free to use all types of things
Healing a spiritual healing that lastingly evolves you
Inertia we don't do things that don't last (only do what's important). 
Research

and the final clinic is called 'star research center' 
and my studnets are people of asheville. peoples muscle testing center (start to see the ball near boulder)
and to do this I: need a new RV after I get money from the sale and travelling for three years always bringing back every 4-5 week stay.
