four things
1. the teaching here is that everything is in obsidian. this unfolds as a manual. syllabi listing. 
	1. now if this can be done with joplin, we are reasonably satisfied with it. but we would love for it to be a syllabus structure that is published through obsidian publish
	2. within the syllabus structure we have
		1. Intro Article, which is the blog post
		2. Book, 1-10
		3. Such that after the book we have audio, and when we click next we have journal (which is a public blog)
