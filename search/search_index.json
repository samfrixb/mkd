I go move after I sell the bus in the fall (see sold bus) and I go to this place: a van to build out online. Then I sell the bus (see around october) then I begin a life of homeschool. The van is: worthy of the calling. A short school bus or something like it. And in the end I will be glad I headed to Asheville, with the bus (see glowing car like a subaru outback on the road as my next car. Something from the father). I'm going up to mystic to get this. so my final plan is as follows: to be near the eastern woods. Mystic, Connecticut for life--with a nutrition office called Star Clinic And I will live in: mystic/Westerly Rhode Island. ANd have a small office that is: a desk, a muscle testing (nutrition massage) table, a deck with a lot of slides in it, and I do muscle testing But the final thing about this is, I can do the work. I live a life where the new master plan is fulfilled every day. I go out by finding a life in new social groups and circles, such that by being in this town (see Asheville) really anywhere near/around it, I won't have missed my destiny. Let's move to Asheville and create Star Clinic Testing all the problmes in the modern world Freedom free to use all types of things Healing a spiritual healing that lastingly evolves you Inertia we don't do things that don't last (only do what's important). Research and the final clinic is called 'star research center' and my studnets are people of asheville. peoples muscle testing center (start to see the ball near boulder) and to do this I: need a new RV after I get money from the sale and travelling for three years always bringing back every 4-5 week stay.","title":"the final hierarchy with Johnna"},{"location":"Notes/2203/02%20Paths/Personal/test/","text":"dsf","title":"Test"},{"location":"Notes/2203/03%20Bringings/The%20route%20to%20the%20website/","text":"four things 1. the teaching here is that everything is in obsidian. this unfolds as a manual. syllabi listing. 1. now if this can be done with joplin, we are reasonably satisfied with it. but we would love for it to be a syllabus structure that is published through obsidian publish 2. within the syllabus structure we have 1.

We all have differenet ways of grasping the highest thigns in the material reality (things like noticing a friend is sad, or observing what a beautiful view we sit before). But when it comes to the spiritual world, this is much more the case. Whereas one can readily dive into past life readings, and another can see walls of information presented in the air about the person he is speaking with; still others have a sense that they know what to do with the day based on the way God has guided them, and others pray and they know something worked out in their life based on what they prayed over. The sense of loss of this connection may be something that is a rarely studied issue, but it should be considered one of high importance. Christians look at the loss of faith as a behavioral issue, the stereotypical view on Christians goes. They want to judge eveyrone for not choosing to see that God had done everything. But where is the source for them to see that light, found within the church? It is such a fundamnetal difference of axioms that the conversation becomes impossible. On the one hand, there are those who cannot understand the intellectual matters. Why should I join this church--I don't see (or perceive) anything about it, or its people. In fact, I have observed a lot of hypocrisy over there, or with Christian churches in the past. Based on my intellectual story, knowing God is similar to knowing the Easter Bunny. And it just doesn't add up to my value system. Another syaing might go, for the Bhuddist type thinker, \"Why should I believe in God? Why should I limit the vastness of what is the supreme of the universe, by limiting or trying to define him?\" This, oddly, matches a Quaker note. Quakers see scripture as a secondary source and connection with God as the primary source. God knows and speaks to each of us \"lovingly and without judgment\" whenever we ask questions (James 1:5). And those who know God are anchored in signs, wonders, and miracles (2 Cor 12:12)","title":" Introduction 2 from Joplin"},{"location":"Q1%202022/0001/_Introduction/","text":"1 Introductory Information In this week's study, we welcome you to this world of assessing the energy body, and it's completion. The ten modules presented in our research and through our courses will provide an interesting way to connect people with their higher self, higher modes of activity, and, some would say, with God. In forming an energetic partnership with the matrix of this world, in terms of the secrets of its energetic life (having an intuitiion that the Great Spirit is speaking to you while in the woods), and of its practical applications throughout the day (feeling you can really connect well with someone), we formulate the possibility of a scientific analysis of our energetic life. We make these things testable--whether you are easily able to grasp the spirit's presence, or whether you connect well with individuals in your life. We look at the health of our membership in and participation with groups such as churches (or pools of friend in bars), as well as the healing force we are able to generate. And, we study the way this inner emotional life's expression as deep states of peace, connection with Godliness, and so on, is marred in the modern world. Will the greatest detractors to our energetic body be trauma, or nutritional issues? Surely these could be relevant. But in this week's study, we take on one aim of focus: the energetics of our world. On Loss: Forming a partnership with heaven in spite of societal spiritual decline Table Of Contents * Does the environment impact us? * What are the tools we use that are harmful? * Can people be well with such existential loss as this? * The paths to be regained * The paths to unfold internally * The world we are living in, reanalyzed In each of these six days of work, we will see a book chapter, an audio lecture, and so on--a full study sequence. For those who just wish to read the books, or just see what our research beheld, they are free to navigate through the sections. All people, practitioners and laypersons alike, have access to the entirety of our course structure. Only slides and the lectures are behind paywalls once you have this document. Please do not share this course, and ruin the integrity of our motion towards improving simplicity and access to complex and advanced study programs. If you have friends you wish to share a portion with, please share portions of the first day, and then encourage them to sign up to view the rest of the content. Or, you can send a donation on their behalf. All students are eligible for certification. This is merit based. If you would like to proceed to subsequent GSR testing courses, please complete your work diligtently and in the format provided. You can sign up for a mentorship/review consultation for us to review your work in advance of submission, or you can just submit it at the time of certification. There is a $200 fee to participate in GSR II and a $400 fee to participate in GSR III. There is a final $150 fee to complete your certification after conducting your own research program through GSR IV, initial access to which is free. Once you have signed up for these, you have completed our program.

The ten modules presented in our research and through our courses will provide an interesting way to connect people with their higher self, higher modes of activity, and, some would say, with God. In forming an energetic partnership with the matrix of this world, in terms of the secrets of its energetic life (having an intuitiion that the Great Spirit is speaking to you while in the woods), and of its practical applications throughout the day (feeling you can really connect well with someone), we formulate the possibility of a scientific analysis of our energetic life. We make these things testable--whether you are easily able to grasp the spirit's presence, or whether you connect well with individuals in your life. We look at the health of our membership in and participation with groups such as churches (or pools of friend in bars), as well as the healing force we are able to generate. And, we study the way this inner emotional life's expression as deep states of peace, connection with Godliness, and so on, is marred in the modern world. Will the greatest detractors to our energetic body be trauma, or nutritional issues? Surely these could be relevant. But in this week's study, we take on one aim of focus: the energetics of our world. On Loss: Forming a partnership with heaven in spite of societal spiritual decline Table Of Contents * Does the environment impact us? * What are the tools we use that are harmful? * Can people be well with such existential loss as this? * The paths to be regained * The paths to unfold internally * The world we are living in, reanalyzed In each of these six days of work, we will see a book chapter, an audio lecture, and so on--a full study sequence. For those who just wish to read the books, or just see what our research beheld, they are free to navigate through the sections. All people, practitioners and laypersons alike, have access to the entirety of our course structure. Only slides and the lectures are behind paywalls once you have this document.

These are independently viewable at the Lecture Base. These talks are general content, and are not specifically tied to the lesson plan. So, if you are ready to get working, you can skip these and get right to printing out the slides and testing away. But for those who have more time, or who want to more completely absorb the lesson, the audio files will be the most important part of your time spent when it comes to forming a cohesive understanding of the issue taught.
